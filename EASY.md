# Wuppo Any% (Easy) Route Notes

## Getting kicked out of the Wumhouse

- Most of this section is scripted
- Choose second dialog option to skip some of Carlo's prattling
- Head to elevator
  - If Liftwum has any idle dialogue that prevents you from activating the elevator right away, just curse that jerk and reset the run
- Go to first floor and get the ice cream, go back to the fourth floor and get caught spilling it
- Waddle to the window instead of waiting for Carlo's thugs to pick you up

## Allesdenker

- Jumping through the water until the Allesdenker's house is a bit faster
- Go see Allesdenker, watch the filmstrip, get your gumgumgun and set a shortcut for it while equipping it
- Ask Allesdenker for a match
  - Match is used later for tunnel and activating the tube system in the Wumhouse

## Best Friend

- Unfortunately, you have to pick the bird up, otherwise Allesdenker's back door doesn't open
- For the least dialogue, choose to read the sign, then say that it says "...Nothing"
- Jump into Allesdenker's chimney and go out the back door

## Fish

- Keep going forward until you see the screaming dude run into the hillside
- Climb up until you jump over the hill towards the sinkhole and activate the Fish fight
- Kill fish (is there RNG manipulation to get him to go total Magikarp every time?)
- Grab bucket
- Go back and into the hillside and talk to the scared dude
   - Choose "Don't be ridiculous" for the least dialogue
- Grab the Fnakker hat

## Snail

- Climb up towards the Blione village
  - Grab your empty ice cream cone on the way (you can sell it later in Popo City)
- Laugh at the Bliones because they're stupid --- apparently that's the hip thing to do
- Go past the altar to the Snail "fight"
  - On Easy, you can mess up a lot and still beat him
- Grab the splenk ball thing

## Slab/Idol

- Put everything on the altar above the right picture
  - Splenk ball -> Splenkhakker
  - Bucket -> Blusser
  - Hat -> Fnakker
  - You -> Wum
- Slab fight starts
- Whoop his phlat ass
- Get ready to jump back on the altar pedestal ASAP
  - You just have to activate it breifly and the tunnel will open
- Grab the Fnakker hat
  - For disguising yourself later as well as for the Guest House
- Grab the splenk ball for selling in Popo City

## Tunnel

- Whip out your match to help you see (set a shortcut for it for the Wumhouse furnace later)
- On Easy, you can tank literally all the damage from the the blue guys
  - Use the high paths in the tunnel for the quickest route through
- (Is it worth transforming the bucket with that guy by the fountain?)
    - Probably not
- (Is it worth visiting the big blue jellyfish dude that shows up later on the Filpside by that one filmstrip?)
    - Maybe for the coins

## Rock

- Talk to the Bliones that show up and tell them you want to go back (lies)
- They'll give you a candle which you can sell later in Popo city
- Head for the rock fight
- Easy fight on easy but the Bliones suck so it's kind of slow
- Head back up to Wumhouse

## Clean up

- Go through all the scripted stuff with Carlo
- Set a shortcut for your cleaning suit for the tube system later
- Clean up your mess
- Go see your new room and grab the bazooka from the guy hiding above it
  - Set a shortcut for the bazooka in the elevator
  - From now on, use the bazooka wherever you can you give you a speed boost
- Go back to the elevator and go to the third floor to grab the stolen fancy cake from the guy on the right
  - You can sell this for 222 smurt so it's pretty important to grab
- Go to the first floor

## Ice Cream

- Head towards the kitchen, laugh at the chefs
- Cream that fatty
  - Gumgumgun better than bazooka for this fight
  - He'll only slurp you up if you get hit by pink bubbles
  - Just stand in front of him when he does green bubbles and you'll only get hit if you're bad
- Shoot the fire after the fight to activate magic bubbles
- Ride magic bubbles up to vacuum tube

## Pre-train Activities

- Throw match into furnace to activate the Wumhouse tube system
- Clean up the leftmost tube on the bottom using your cleaning suit
- Ride it to a small room which has an oonion in the leftmost box
  - Getting this oonion saves you a fight in the Sinkhole later, and an entire trip down and back up to Chef Fnaquere
- Ride the tube back to the furnace room and take the only tube on the left wall to the room above those two guys with the chip card
  - Save in the bucket if you're not confident you'll steal the chip card first time
- It has to be nighttime for you to steal the chip card
  - If you were fast enough, it should be night and you can just go right to steal it
  - If you weren't fast enough, it'll be daytime. Head to the bath room and sit in the bath for a while to speed up the transition to nighttime
- Jump out the window and into the room with the chip card
- Steal the chip card
  - If you knock anything over in the room, you'll be caught
    - Load your bucket save if you're caught and try again
  - Always jump past the dishes to avoid knocking them over (i.e. never walk past them)
  - Don't sit in the bowl for too long to avoid knocking it over
- Head back out to the window
- Jump down to the Wumhouse entrance and tell Carlo you're leaving; once you head back outside he'll call you over and give you more ice cream, which you can sell in Popo City
  - Skip this if you think you'll miss the train
- Head to the train. If you were fast enough it should be waiting there for you
  - (TODO: List some estimated train times)
  - If you have to wait for the train, you have a good five minutes to cry, or you can go to Wondersplenk and gamble your smurt away, I don't care (actually I do)
- Use your stolen chip card and get on the train

## Dorst's Caffe (Optional)

- You can kill the Caffe monster which gets you smurt, and then you can sell the blappuchino the baristwum gives you in Popo City, or you can skip the cafe and make up the smurt via more fishing and organized crime
- If you do the Caffe monster fight, you can tank most of the damage on Easy, but be careful near the pot
  - Use the bazooka, you can kill the monster in like 6 hits or something
  - Ask yourself why so much food comes to life in this game

## Getting to 99999 Credit

- The socialist dream of credit is a unique and profound construct designed to unite the wums of Popo City with the promise of a reward they all helped to achieve, so naturally the fastest way to complete the speedrun is to exploit the credit system via organized crime XD
- The general idea is to go to the criminal dude on the docks above Aqua Henk and buy stuff off of him. His prices are insane but he gives 1000 credit per item (because he's a criminal) so it's the fastest way to get to 99999 credit. Read on to find out more.
- Jump through Old Town and head right for the tram.
  - If you were fast enough up to this point you should make it
  - If you don't make the tram, it's faster to bazooka-boost across the bridge
    - Grab the hooks on the way under the bridge; you can sell them at the store
- Head to the Popo City Hotel and buy a ticket
  - You don't have to talk to the conciergewum there, just throw your smurt on him
- Enter the hotel and hope you get a good item you can sell or something
- Enter the save bucket in your hotel room to make it nighttime in Popo City
 - Making it nighttime lets you partake in organized crime right away, since the criminal dude above Aqua Henk doesn't come out until it's night
- Go to the Popo City store and sell everything you can
  - You can't sell the empty ice cream here, but criminal dude will buy it
  - Sell only 5 of the cherries, keep the other 5 for Guest House
- Buy a Popo Hat and 3-5 quality hooks
  - If you have a discount coupon, throw it on the shopkeepwum to buy the Popo Hat
  - You can use crappy hooks, but they're crap and you'll be stuck fishing for an hour, so don't
- Head towards Aqua Henk and talk to the criminal dude on the docks above it
  - If you'd like you can set some hooks up here but you'll have to take whatever they catch
- Agree to help his friend in jail
- Head to the jail and put on your Popo Hat (set a shortcut for it too)
- Once the guard gets to the second level of cells, open the friend's cell with your Popo Hat (it's the cell on the top level with the guy in the purple hat)
- Book it out of the jail
  - It's hard to get caught but if you do you'll have to pay 25 smurt, oh well
- Head back to Aqua Henk docks and get your 250 smurt reward from criminal dude. His shop is now accessible.
- Commence farming for stuff to sell by fishing.
  - You need to get to about 20000 - 23000 credit on the sign on his shop outside, it varies based on timing.
    - Once the credit stream stops, the sign outside his shop will go red, or he'll tell you in his shop after you've bought something
  - This means you need to buy about 20 items from him, which costs at least 46 * 20 = 920 smurt (the cheapest item is the rotting blak, which costs 48 smurt and you can sell back to him for 2 smurt)
  - Unless you're really lucky there's no way you have 920 smurt right now, so you have to fish for items to sell to him
  - While you're fishing, you need to get the fishing guy's hat at some point
    - You don't need to talk to him first, just throw the hat on him and ask him for a reward
    - He'll give you the master ball hook, which will always catch the swimsuit needed for Breevis (unless you have the swimsuit, then it will give you the bazooka modifier)
  - You'll almost always want to buy a lot of quality hooks from the criminal dude
    - They're more expensive but give you better return on investment since you catch more valuable items
  - Once you place hooks, you can go to the save bucket in Aqua Henk and keep repeatedly saving until you see an item appear on the hook. Then you can load your last bucket save to re-roll the item to get a more valuble one.
    - The gumgumgun modifiers are the most valuable, giving you at least 138 smurt each
    - TODO: list more items and values
  - You also want to catch at least one gumgumgun modifier that you don't sell to the criminal dude, but will use for your gun instead. This is basically necessary for saving time on the later boss fights.
    - It doesn't really matter what modifier you get, especially on Easy, you just need more DPS
  - Keep farming items and selling them to the criminal dude until the credit stream stop
    - Once you know you have enough smurt to stop the credit stream (i.e. once you have enough to have bought ~20 items), you can stop buying quality hooks (as long as you have an extra modifier for your gun), and just buy rotting blak and junk (the cheapest items) until the credit stream stops
  - This sounds really tedious but once you get into a flow in can go pretty quickly
    - Tips:
      - Remember you can use RB/LB (R1/L1) to switch between throwing targets, which makes adding hooks to fishing lines easier with that hat dude standing right there
- Once you've bought enough items to stop the credit stream, go grab Breevis's toy from Aqua Henk
